Don't afraid to use Git! even break it!
## Git Operations
```bash
git branch        check current branch

git stauts        check changes of current branch

git checkout -b 'my-new-feature'            create a new branch and change to it

git commit -am 'Add some feature'

# Set upstream(bind) with remote feature branch
git push --set-upstream origin <remote-branch-name>
```
